===================================

Congratulations on installing Atheno!

You are now ready to access the Kubernetes IDE. Hereâ€™s how:

Step 1: Wait for atheno pods to move to READY state: `kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l released-by=atheno -n atheno`

Step 2: Get the Cluster IP - Run the following command to find your cluster's IP address: `kubectl get nodes -o wide`

Step 3: Access the Atheno UI - Open your web browser and go to: `http://<cluster-node-ip>:30003`. Replace `<cluster-node-ip>` with the IP address you obtained in Step 2.

For Docker Desktop Users: If you are using Docker Desktop Kubernetes Engine, you need to forward the port to access the atheno service. Run: `kubectl port-forward svc/atheno-service -n atheno 30003:65080`

Then, open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:30003`

Enjoy using Atheno!
